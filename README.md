This is the home of the [BlockFor.fun public registry](https://registry.blockfor.fun). This is where we host [the blockfor.fun root database](root.db) for the [BlockFor.fun](https://blockfor.fun/) apps.

All entries are built from the [public git repository](https://github.com/blockforfun/registry.git) that you can find on the [repository GitHub page](https://github.com/blockforfun/registry/) where you can find [the source of this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockforfun/registry/master/README.md) and all the other sources we build from.
